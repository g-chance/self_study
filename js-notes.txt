HTML:
    -add script tags to the head of and html document with the 'defer' attribute. This ensures that the scripts are loaded
     at the same time as the html document, but isn't executed until after the html document is parsed
        -to explicitly load a script BEFORE html is parsed, use the async attribute. Note that this does NOT guarantee
         the order of script execution(so don't use with scripts that are dependent on other scripts)
        - defer and async won't have any effect with in-line scripts
Boolean Tricks:
    -using a double bang(!!) will convert any datatype into a true boolean,
    ie. (0 normally yields a 'falsy' value, but !!0 would actually convert it to 'false', just as !0 converts it to 'true)
    -can use the ||(or) operator to assign values to variables when you may be uncertain of whether a value you're
    assigning to the variable will be truthy (ie. a user input that may an empty string)
        -can use the &&(and) operator to do the opposite (assign a different value to a variable only if the first value
        is truthy, this makes the most sense when dealing with actual boolean values, rather than falsy / truthy ones.
        ie. (let isLoggedIn = true; variable = isLoggedIn && 'Max')
