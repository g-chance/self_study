CSS Modules
    note: must be using react-scripts v2xx.. for higher for the below to work
        -create css files with the .module.css extension
        -use the 'import classes from <filename>.module.css> to import
    -see the 'more on css modules' section in react-complete course for more useful information

Optimization:
    UseEffect() =>
        -sometimes it's a good idea to wrap the component in your component export with React.memo when using UseEffect
        with functional components (ie. export default React.memo(<Component>)). This will prevent the UseEffect
        Hook from triggering if nothing that the component renders actually changes (this is most relevant if UseEffect
        would have been triggered by props changing, signaling something may have changed in a parent, but which is not
        necessarily rendered in the component), because the previous state of the component will be memoized (yes 
        memoized, like with dynamic programming), and therefore used again if nothing has changed.
            -import to note: you should NOT do this unless you believe there are circumstances where you actually
            wouldn't want the component to re-render as described above

Planning an App:
    1. Component Tree / Component Structure
    2. Application state
    3. Components vs. Containers (stateless vs. stateful components)
