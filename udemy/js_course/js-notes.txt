HTML:
    -add script tags to the head of and html document with the 'defer' attribute. This ensures that the scripts are loaded
     at the same time as the html document, but isn't executed until after the html document is parsed
        -to explicitly load a script BEFORE html is parsed, use the async attribute. Note that this does NOT guarantee
         the order of script execution(so don't use with scripts that are dependent on other scripts)
        - defer and async won't have any effect with in-line scripts
