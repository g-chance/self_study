variables:
    -must declare variables with let or const
        -const must be initialized (assigned value) and cannot be reassigned afterwards
        -let doesn't have to be initialized (assign value) when declared, and can be resassigned
    -if you forget to declare a variable, it will be auto declared in the global scope -- this is BAD practice

functions:
    -defined by: function()
    -hoisted to the top of the script on execution
    -you CAN access and change global+parent scope variables from within a function (not the other way around), but it is BAD practice
        -a function that does NOT change global variables and only works with variables within it's scope is a 'pure' function
        -declaring a variable with the same name inside the function as a global variable will prevent the global variable from being
            overwritten (this is more like python). These are called 'Shadowed Variables'

syntax:
    -expressions end with a semicolon
    -no semicolon necessary after a statement(ie. functions, loops)

type conversion:
    -js makes assumptions about what you intended and implicitly converts data types to avoid errors (ie. if you try to 
        add a string and a number, js will convert the number to a string and concatenate them)
    -to explicitly convert data a number, use the parse<NumberType>(Data) function or add a '+' in front of the string
    -to explicitly convert data to a string, use the <Data>.toString() method

objects:
    -similar to dictionaries
    -use '.'(dot) notation to access keys(also called properties)/values (ie. object.key will return the value stored in key)

built-ins:
    -python: type(<data>) == js: typeof <data>

conditionals:
  -COMPARISON OPERATORS:
    -in js, the '===' operator exists to compare whether value AND type are equal, because the '==' operator could compare
    equal when comparing a number to a string because of js's implicit type conversion (ie. 2 == "2")
    -a bang(!) in js essentially replaces the 'not' keyword in python
    -different objects in js will NEVER compare equal, whereas in python they can(using ==)
    -&&(js) == and(py); ||(js) == or(py)
  -elif(python) == else if(js)
  -TRUTHY / FALSY
    -in js, empty objects ARE evaluated as true (in python they are not)
  -TERNARY
    -in js, written as <boolean ? value1 : value1> (which translates to `if boolean then value1 else value2)
    -in py, writte as <value1 if boolean else value2>

loops:
  -for loop
    js: for(let i=0; i<5; i++)
    py: for i in range(5)
  -for-of loop (iterate over all elements of an array)
    js: for(const num of nums)
    py: for num in nums
  -for-in loop (iterate over all keys in a dictionary)
    js: for(const key in dict)
    py: for key in dict
  -while loop (no major differences)
  -do-while loop (only in js - execute code BEFORE checking condition, 
    ie. the below code will log 3 whereas a normal while loop wouldn't
        j = 3; 
        do { 
          console.log(j);
        } while (j < 3);
