.NET is not limited to C#
    CLR - Common Language Runtime
        translates bytevode into native code(machine code) - called JIT (Just in Time compilation)
    Class Library
        Assembly == dll(dynamically linked library) or exe file, which is a container of related namespaces(namespace == related classes)

Data Types
    Primitive Types
        -real number types include float, double, and decimal, however c# always defaults to double when initializing 
        any of these types, so to use float and decimal, they have to be.. set explicitly like
            float number = 1.2f 
            decimal number = 1.2m
        where the f tells c# the type is float, and m is decimal

Overflowing
    in c#, integer overflow happens when a number is larger than its datatype allows. By default, this fails silently
    and will 'reset' the number (ie. if max is 255 and you add 2, you end up with 1). The "checked" keyword will cause
    an exception to be thrown like
        checked 
        { 
            byte number = 255;
            number = number + 1;
        }

Operators
    Arithmetic
        Increment(++) and Decrement(--) operators can be applied prefix or postfix. If postfixed (ie. a++), the
        increment happens AFTER any expression which may be referencing it, like
            int a = 1;
            int b = a++;
        then b will be assigned to 1 before a is increased to 2. But if it was prefixed (ie ++a), then a would be
        incremented by 1 before being assigned to b, and they would both be equal to 2.
